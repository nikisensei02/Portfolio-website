Hello, I'm Nikhsep, a passionate and driven B.Tech student currently studying at Delhi Technological University in Delhi. At 22 years old, I have a keen interest in web development and specialize in MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN stack). I'm also currently honing my skills in Next.js to create even more powerful and efficient web applications.

Throughout my academic journey, I've been dedicated to mastering various aspects of full-stack development, with a focus on creating robust and user-friendly applications. I thrive on challenges and enjoy diving into complex problems, leveraging my knowledge and skills to find innovative solutions.

I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving field of web development. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I'm committed to delivering high-quality, scalable, and maintainable solutions for any project I undertake.

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new places, engaging in outdoor activities, and connecting with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology and innovation.
